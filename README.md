# The Game
This browser game is an implementation of a popular card game.

We started this project in November 2020 and roughly needed a month for the first version. Our frontend uses JavaScript and we implemented our backend in Golang. Our stack includes
* [PixiJS](https://pixijs.io/)
* [tween.js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/)
* [nhooyr.io/websocket](https://github.com/nhooyr/websocket)
